BEHIND THE TREES XII THE SECRET OF THE TOWER XIII RIGHT OF CONQUEST XIV THE SCEPTER IN THE GRAVE XV NORMAL CASE XVI DEAD MAJESTY XVII THE CHIEF MOURNERS XVIII THE GOLD AND THE TREASURE CHAPTER DOCTOR MARYS PAYING GUEST Just in time wasnt it asked Mary Arkroyd Two days before the the ceremony Mercifully it had all been kept very quiet because it was only three months since poor Gilly was killed forget whether you ever met Gilly My half-brother you know Only once in Collingham Gardens He had an _exeat_ and dashed in one Saturday morning when we were just finishing our work Dont you remember Yes think do But since my engagement Id gone into colors Oh of course Ive gone back into mourning now And everything was ready settlements and so on you know And rooms taken at Bournemouth And then it all came out How Well Eustace Captain Cranster mean Oh think he really must have had shell-shock as he said even though the doctor seemed to doubt it He gave the Colonel as reference in some shop and and the bank wouldnt pay the check Other checks turned up too and in the end the police went through his papers and found letters from well from her you know From Bogota South America isnt it Hed lived there ten years you know growing something beans or coffee or coffee-beans or something dont know what He tried to say the marriage wasnt binding but the Colonel wasnt it providential that the Colonel was home on leave Mamma could never have grappled with it The Colonel was sure it was and so were the lawyers What happened then The great thing was to keep it quiet Now wasnt it And there was the shell-shock or so Eustace Captain Cranster mean said anyhow So on the Colonels advice Mamma squared the check business and and they gave him twenty-four hours to clear out Papa call the Colonel Papa you know though hes really my stepfather used little influence think Anyhow it was managed never saw him again Mary Poor dear Was it very bad Yes But suppose we had been married Mary where should have been Mary Arkroyd left that problem alone Were you very fond of him she asked Awfully Cynthia turned up to her friend pretty blue eyes suffused in tears It was the end of the world to me That there could be such men went to bed Mamma could do nothing with me Oh well she wrote to you about all that She told me you were in pretty bad way was just desperate Then one day in bed the thought of you came It seemed an absolute inspiration remembered the card you sent on my last birthday youve never forgotten my birthdays though its years since we met with your new address here and your Doctor and all the letters after your name thought it rather funny faint smile the first since Miss Walfords arrival at Inkston probably the first since Captain Eustace Cransters shell-shock had wrought catastrophe appeared on her lips How waited for your answer You dont mind having me do you dear Mamma insisted on suggesting the arrangement was afraid youd shy at it Not bit should have liked to have you anyhow but can make you much more comfortable with the money And your maid too she looks as if she was accustomed to the best By the way need she be quite so tearful Shes more tearful than you are yourself Jeannes very very fond of me Cynthia murmured reproachfully Oh well get her out of that said Mary briskly The tears mean not the fondness Im very fond of you myself Six years ago you were charming kitten and used to enjoy being your visiting governess to say nothing of finding the guineas very handy while was waiting to qualify Youre rather like kitten still one of those blue-eyed ones Siamese arent they with close fur and wondering look But you mustnt mew down here and you must have lots of milk and cream Even if rations go on can certify all the extras for you Thats the good of being doctor She laughed cheerfully as she took cigarette from the mantelpiece and lit it Cynthia on the other hand began to sob prettily and not in noisy fashion yet evidently heading towards bout of grief Moreover no sooner had the first sound of lamentation escaped from her lips than the door was opened smartly and buxom girl in ladys maid uniform rushed in darted across the room and knelt by Cynthia sobbing also and exclaiming Oh my poor Mees Cynthia Mary smiled in humorous contempt Stop this she commanded rather brusquely Youve not been deceived too have you Jeanne Me madame No My poor Mees Leave your poor Mees to me She took paper bag from the mantelpiece Go and eat chocolates Fixed with firm and decidedly professional glance Jeanne stopped sobbing and rose slowly to her feet Dont listen outside the door You must have been listening Wait till youre rung for Miss Cynthia will be all right with me Were going for walk Take her upstairs and put her hat on her and thick coat its cold and going to rain think walk Mary Cynthias sobs stopped to make way for this protest The description of the weather did not sound attractive Yes yes Now off with both of you Here take the chocolates Jeanne and try to remember that it might have been worse Jeannes brown eyes were eloquent of reproach Captain Cranster might have been found out too late after the wedding Mary explained with smile Try to look at it like that Five minutes to get ready Cynthia She was ready for the weather herself in the stout coat and skirt and weather-proof hat in which she had driven the two-seater on her round that morning The disconsolate pair drifted ruefully from the room though Jeanne did recollect to take the chocolates Doctor Mary stood looking down at the fire her lips still shaped in that firm wise and philosophical smile with which doctors and nurses and indeed sometimes anybody who happens to be feeling pretty well himself console or exasperate suffering humanity very good thing the poor silly child did come to me That was the form her thoughts took For although Dr Mary Arkroyd was and knew herself to be no dazzling genius at her profession in moments of candor she would speak of having scraped through her qualifying examinations she had high opinion of her own common sense and her power of guiding weaker mortals For all that Jeannes cheek bulged with chocolate there was open resentment on her full pouting lips and hint of the same feeling in Cynthias still liquid eyes when mistress and maid came downstairs again Without heeding these signs Mary drew on her gauntlets took her walking-stick and flung the hall door open rush of cold wind filled the little hall Jeanne shivered ostentatiously Cynthia sighed and muffled herself deeper in her fur collar good walking day said Mary decisively Up to now Inkston had not impressed Cynthia Walford very favorably It was indeed mixed kind of place Like many villages which lie near to London and have been made by modern developments more accessible than once they were it showed chronological strata in its buildings Down by the station all was new red suburban Mounting the tarred road the wayfarer bore slightly to the right along the original village street bating the aggressive fronts of one or two commercial innovators this was old calm serene gray in tone and restful ornamented by three or four good class Georgian houses one quite fine with well wrought iron gates this was Dr Irechesters turning to the right again but more sharply the wayfarer found himself once more in villadom but villadom more ornate more costly with gardens to be measured in acres or nearly This was Hinton Avenue Hinton because it was the maiden name of the builders wife Avenue because avenue is genteel Here Mary dwelt but by good luck her predecessor Dr Christian Evans had seized upon surviving old cottage at the end of the avenue and indeed of Inkston village itself Beyond it stretched meadows while the road turning again ran across an open heath and pursued its way to Sprotsfield four miles distant place of greater size where all amenities could be found It was along this road that the friends now walked Mary setting brisk pace When once youve turned your back on the Avenue its heaps better she said Might be real country looking this way mightnt it Except the Naylors place Oh and Tower Cottage there are no houses between this and Sprotsfield The wind blew shrewdly with an occasional spatter of rain the withered bracken lay like vast carpet of dull copper-color under the cloudy sky scattered fir-trees made fantastic shapes in the early gloom of December day somber scene yet wanting only sunshine to make it flash in richness of color even to-day its quiet and spaciousness its melancholy and monotony seemed to bid sympathetic and soothing welcome to aching and fretted hearts It really is rather nice out here Cynthia admitted come almost every afternoon Oh Ive plenty of time My round in the morning generally sees me through except for emergencies births and deaths and so on You see my predecessor poor Christian Evans never had more than the leavings and thats all Ive got believe the real doctor the old-established one Dr Irechester was angry at first with Dr Evans for coming he didnt want rival But Christian was such meek mild simple little Welshman not the least pushing or ambitious and very soon Dr Irechester whos quite well off was glad to leave him the dirty work mean she explained smiling the cottages and the panel work National Insurance you know and so on Well as you know came down as _locum_ for Christian he was fellow-student of mine and when the dear little man was killed in France Dr Irechester himself suggested that should stay on He was rather nice He said We all started to laugh at you at first but we dont laugh now anyhow only my wife does So if you stay on dont doubt we shall work very well together my dear colleague Wasnt that rather nice of him Cynthia Yes dear said Cynthia in voice that sounded good many miles away Mary laughed Im bound to be interested in you but suppose youre not bound to be interested in me she observed resignedly All the same made sensation at Inkston just at first And they were even more astonished when it turned out that could dance and play lawn tennis Thats funny little place said Cynthia pointing to the left side of the road Tower Cottage thats called But what funny place Cynthia insisted round tower like Martello tower only smaller of course and what looks just like an ordinary cottage or small farm-house joined on to it What could the tower have been for Im sure dont know Origin lost in the mists of antiquity An old gentleman named Saffron lives there now patient of yours Mary Oh no Hes well off rich believe So he belongs to Dr Irechester But often meet him along the road Lately theres always been younger man with him companion or secretary or something of that sort hear he is There are two men coming along the road now Yes thats them the old man and his friend Hes rather striking to look at Which of them The old man of course havent looked at the secretary Cynthia believe youre beginning to feel little better Oh no Im not Im afraid Im not really But there had been cheerfully roguish little smile on her face It vanished very promptly when observed The two men approached them on their way no doubt to Tower Cottage The old man was not above middle height indeed scarcely reached it but he made the most of his inches carrying himself very upright with an air of high dignity Close-cut white hair showed under an old-fashioned peaked cap he wore plaid shawl swathed round him his left arm being enveloped in its folds his right rested in the arm of his companion who was taller than he lean and loose-built clad in an almost white and very unseasonable looking suit of some homespun material He wore no covering on his head thick crop of curly hair of color indistinguishable in the dim light presumably affording such protection as he needed His face was turned down towards the old man who was looking up at him and apparently talking to him though in so low tone that no sound reached Mary and Cynthia as they passed by Neither man gave any sign of noticing their presence Mr Saffron you said Rather queer name but he looks nice old man patriarchal you know Whats the name of the other one did hear somebody mentioned him at the Naylors somebody who had heard something about him in France What was the name It was something queer too think Theyve got queer names and they live in queer house Cynthia actually gave little laugh But are you going to walk all night Mary dear Oh poor thing forgot you Youre tired Well turn back They retraced their steps again passing Tower Cottage into which its occupants must have gone for they were no longer to be seen That names on the tip of my tongue said Mary in amused vexation shall get it in moment Cynthia had relapsed into gloom It doesnt matter in the least she murmured Its Beaumaroy said Mary in triumph dont wonder you couldnt remember that CHAPTER II THE GENERAL REMEMBERS Amongst other various and no doubt useful functions Miss Delia Wall performed that of gossip and news agent-general to the village of Inkston hard-featured swarthy spinster of forty with roving inquisitive yet not unkindly eye she perambulated or rather percycled the district taking stock of every incident Not cat could kitten or dog have the mange without her privity critics of her mental activity went near to insinuating connivance Naturally therefore she was well acquainted with the new development at Tower Cottage although the isolated position of that dwelling made thorough observation piquantly difficult She laid her information before an attentive if not very respectful audience gathered round the tea-table at Old Place the Naylors handsome house on the outskirts of Sprotsfield and on the far side of the heath from Inkston She was enjoying herself although she was as usual trifle distrustful of the quality of Mr Naylors smile it smacked of the satiric He looks at you as if you were specimen she had once been heard to complain and when she said specimen it was obviously beetles that she had in mind Everybody knows old Mr Saffron by sight mean and the woman who does for him she said Theres never been anything remarkable about _them_ He took his walk as regular as clockwork every afternoon and she bought just the same things every week her books must have tallied almost to penny every month Mrs Naylor know it And it was very rare thing indeed for Mr Saffron to go to London though have known him to be away once or twice But very very rarely She paused and added dramatically Until the armistice Full of ramifications that event Miss Wall It affects even my business Mr Naylor though now withdrawn from an active share in its conduct was still interested in the large shipping firm from which he had drawn his comfortable fortune She looked at him suspiciously as he put the ends of the slender white fingers of his two hands together and leant forward to listen with that smile of his and eyes faintly twinkling But the problem was seething in her brain she had to go on week after the armistice Mr Saffron went to London by the He traveled first Anna Did he dear Mrs Naylor stout and placid dame was not yet stirred to excitement He came down by the and those two men with him And theyve been there ever since Two men Delia Ive only seen one Oh yes theres another Sergeant Hooper they call him short thickset man with black mustache He buys two bottles of rum every week at the _Green Man_ And one minute please Mr Naylor was only going to say that it looks to me as if this man Hooper were or had been soldier What do you think Never mind Papa Go on Miss Wall Im interested This encouragement came from Gertie Naylor pretty girl of seventeen who was consuming much tea bread and honey And since then the old gentleman and this Mr Beaumaroy go to town regularly every week on Wednesdays Now who are they how did Mr Saffron get hold of them and what are they doing here Im at loss Anna Apparently an _impasse_ And Mr Naylor did not seem to assist matters by asking whether Miss Wall had kept constant eye on the Agony Column Mrs Naylor took up her knitting and switched off to another topic Dr Arkroyds friend Delia dear What charming girl she looks Friend Anna didnt know that patient understand anyhow Shes taking Valentines beef juice Of course they _do_ give that in drink cases but should be sorry to think Drugs more likely Mr Naylor suavely interposed Then he rose from his chair and began to pace slowly up and down the long room looking at his beautiful pictures his beautiful china his beautiful chairs all the beautiful things that were his His family took no notice of this roving up and down it was habit and was tacitly accepted as meaning that he had for the moment had enough of the company and even of his own sallies at its expense Ive asked Dr Arkroyd to bring her over Miss Walford mean the first day its fine enough for tennis Mrs Naylor pursued There was hard court at Old Place so that winter did not stop the game entirely What name too Walford Its quite good name Delia No no Anna Beaumaroy of course Miss Wall was back at the larger problem Theres Alecs voice He and the General are back from their golf Ring for another teapot Gertie dear The door opened not Alec but the General came in and closed the door carefully behind him it was obviously an act of precaution and not merely normal exercise of good manners Then he walked up to his hostess and said Its not my fault Anna Alec would do it though shook my head at him behind the fellows back What do you mean General cried the hostess Mr Naylor for his part stopped roving The door again Come in Mr Beaumaroy heres tea Mr Beaumaroy obediently entered in the wake of Captain Alec Naylor who duly presented him to Mrs Naylor adding that Beaumaroy had been kind enough to make the fourth in game with the General the Rector of Sprotsfield and himself And he and the parson were too tough nut for us werent they sir he added to the General Besides being an excellent officer and capital fellow Alec Naylor was also reputed to be one of the handsomest men in the Service six foot three very straight very fair with features as regular as any romantic hero of them all and eyes as blue The honorable limp that at present marked his movements would it was hoped pass away Even his own family were often surprised into new admiration of his physical perfections remarking one to the other how Alec took the shine out of every other man in the room There was no shine no external obvious shine to take out of Mr Beaumaroy Miss Walls puzzling unaccounted-for Mr Beaumaroy The light showed him now more clearly than when Mary Arkroyd met him on the heath road but perhaps thereby did him no service His features though irregular were not ugly or insignificant but he wore rather battered aspect there were deep lines running from the corners of his mouth and crowsfeet had started under the gray eyes which in their turn looked more skeptical than ardent rather mocking than eager Yet when he smiled his face became not merely pleasant but confidentially pleasant he seemed to smile especially to and for the person to whom he was talking and his voice was notably agreeable soft and clear the voice of high-bred man but not exactly of high-bred Englishman There was no accent definite enough to be called foreign certainly not to be assigned to any particular race but there was an exotic touch about his manner of speech suggesting that even if not that of foreigner it was shaped and colored by the inflexions of foreign tongues The hue of his plentiful and curly hair indistinguishable to Mary and Cynthia now stood revealed as neither ',\n",

XXII UNMASKED XXIII THE JOURNALISTS ABDICATE XXIV CHEERFUL BLUNDER CHAPTER THE HOBO AT CHAZY JUNCTION Mr Judkins the station agent at Chazy Junction came out of his little house at daybreak shivered bit in the chill morning air and gave an involuntary start as he saw private car on the sidetrack There were two private cars to be exact sleeper and baggage car and Mr Judkins knew the three oclock train must have left them as it passed through Ah said he aloud the nabobs hev arrove Who are the nabobs asked quiet voice beside him Again Mr Judkins started he even stepped back pace to get better view of the stranger who had approached so stealthily through the dim light that the agent was unaware of his existence until he spoke Who be you he demanded eyeing the man suspiciously Never mind who am retorted the other in grumpy tone the original question is who are the nabobs See here young feller this aint no place fer tramps observed Mr Judkins frowning with evident displeasure Chazy Junctions got all it kin do to support its reglar inhabitants Youll hev to move on The stranger sat down on baggage truck and eyed the private car reflectively He wore rough gray suit baggy and threadbare flannel shirt with an old black tie carelessly knotted at the collar brown felt hat with several holes in the crown and coarse cowhide shoes that had arrived at the last stages of usefulness You would judge him to be from twenty-five to thirty years of age you would note that his face was browned from exposure that it was rather set and expressionless but in no way repulsive His eyes dark and retrospective were his most redeeming feature yet betrayed little of their owners character Mr Judkins could make nothing of the fellow beyond the fact that he was doubtless tramp and on that account most unwelcome in this retired neighborhood Even tramps were unusual at Chazy Junction The foothills were sparsely settled and the inhabitants too humble to be attractive to gentlemen of the road while the rocky highways tortuous and uneven offered no invitation to the professional pedestrian Youll hev to move on repeated the agent more sternly cant replied the other with smile The car was er attached to has come to halt The engine has left us and here we are and the nabobs Ben ridin the trucks eh No rear platform Very comfortable it was and no interruptions The crazy old train stopped so many times during the night that scarcely woke up when they sidetracked us here and the first thing knew was abandoned in this wilderness As it grew light began to examine my surroundings and discovered you Glad to meet you sir You neednt be Dont begrudge me the pleasure implore you cant blame you for being gruff and unsociable were you otherwise you wouldnt reside at at he turned his head to read the half legible sign on the station house at Chazy Junction Im familiar with most parts of the United States but Chazy Junction gets my flutters Why oh why in the world did it happen Mr Judkins scowled but made no answer He was wise enough to understand he was no match in conversation for this irresponsible outcast who knew the great world as perfectly as the agent knew his junction He turned away and stared hard at the silent sleeper the appearance of which was not wholly unexpected You havent informed me who the nabobs are nor why they choose to be sidetracked in this forsaken stone-quarry remarked the stranger eyeing the bleak hills around him in the growing light of dawn The agent hesitated His first gruff resentment had been in manner disarmed and he dearly loved to talk especially on so interesting subject as the nabobs He knew he could astonish the tramp and the temptation to do so was too strong to resist Its the great John Merrick whos got millions to burn but dont light many bonfires he began not very graciously at first Two years ago he bought the Capn Wegg farm over by Millville an Wheres Millville inquired the man Seven mile back in the hills The farm aint nuthin but cobblestone an pine woods but How big is Millville Quite town Eleven stores an houses sides the mill an big settlement buildin up at Royal where the new paper mill is jest started Royals four mile up the Little Bill Hill But about the nabob Mr Merrick think you called him Yes John Merrick He bought the Capn Wegg place an spent summer fore last on it him an his three gals as is his nieces Oh three girls Yes Clever gals too Stirred things up some at Millville kin tell you stranger Libral an good-natured but able to hold their own with the natives We missed em last year but tother day seen ol Hucks that keeps their house for em he his wife an Hucks said they was cumin to spend this summer at the farm an he was lookin fer em any day The way they togged up thet farmhouse is somethin wonerful Im told Haint seen it myself but whole carload furnitoor an then some more was shipped here from New York an Peggy McNutt over Millville says it must cost for-tun The tramp nodded somewhat listlessly feel quite respectable this morning having passed the night as the guest of millionaire he observed Mr Merrick didnt know it of course or he would have invited me inside Like enough answered the agent seriously The nabobs thet reckless an unaccountable hes likely to do worse ner that Thats what makes him an his gals interestin nobody in quarries How about breakfast friend Judkins Thats my business an not yourn My missus never feeds tramps Rather ungracious to travelers eh Ef youre traveler go to the hoe-tel yonder an buy your breakfas like man Thank you may follow your advice The agent walked up the track and put out the semaphore lights for the sun was beginning to rise over the hills By the time he came back colored porter stood on the platform of the private car and nodded to him Folks up yit asked Judkins Dressing seh Goin ter feed em in there Not dis mohnin Deyll breakfas at de hotel Carriage here yit Not yit spose ol Hucksll drive over for em said the agent Deys spectin some one seh As fer me gotta live heah all day an it makes me sick teh think of it Heh retorted the agent scornfully you wont git sick Youre too well paid fer that The porter grinned and just then little old gentleman with rosy cheery face pushed him aside and trotted down the steps Mornin Judkins he cried and shook the agents hand What glorious sunrise and what crisp delicious air Ah but its good to be in old Chazy County again The agent straightened up his face wreathed with smiles and cast an told you so glance toward the man on the truck But the stranger had disappeared CHAPTER II THE INVASION OF MILLVILLE Over the brow of the little hill appeared three-seated wagon drawn by pair of handsome sorrels and in moment the equipage halted beside the sleeper Oh Thomas Hucks you dear dear Thomas cried clear eager voice and out from the car rushed Miss Patricia Doyle to throw her arms about the neck of the old stoop-shouldered and white-haired driver whose face was illumined by joyous smile Glad to see ye Miss Patsy right glad ndeed child returned the old man But others were waiting to greet him pretty Beth De Graf and dainty Louise Merrick not Louise Merrick any longer though but bearing new name she had recently acquired and demure Mary Patsys little maid and an old friend of Thomas Hucks and Uncle John with his merry laugh and cordial handshake and finally tall and rather dandified young man who remained an interested spectator in the background until Mr Merrick seized and dragged him forward Heres another for you to know Thomas said the little millionaire This is the other half of our Louise Mr Arthur Weldon and by and by you can judge whether hes the better half or not The aged servant hat in hand made respectful bow to Mr Weldon His frank eyes swept the young man from head to foot but his smile was the same as before Miss Louise is wiser ner be said the old fellow simply Im safe to trust to her jedgment guess There was general laugh at this and they began to clamber aboard the wagon and to stow away beneath the seats the luggage the colored porter was bringing out Stop at the Junction House Thomas said Mr Merrick as they moved away Nora has the breakfast all ready at home sir replied Thomas Good for Nora But we cant fast until we reach home eight good miles of jolting so well stop at the Junction House for glass of Mrs Todds famous milk Very good sir Is anyone coming for our trunks and freight Theres half car of truck to be carted over Neds on the way sir and hell get the liveryman to help if he cant carry it all The Junction House was hidden from the station by the tiny hill as were the half dozen other buildings tributary to Chazy Junction As the wagon drew up before the long piazza which extended along the front of the little frame inn they saw man in shabby gray seated at small table with some bread and glass of milk before him It was their unrecognized guest of the night the uninvited lodger on the rear platform but he did not raise his eyes or appear to notice the new arrivals Mrs Todd Hey Mrs Todd called Uncle John Anybody milked the cow yet frowsy looking woman came out all smiles and nodded pleasantly at the expectant group in the wagon Behind her loomed the tall lean form of Lucky Todd the proprietor who was serious as goat which animal he closely resembled in feature Breakfas all round Mr Merrick asked the woman Not this time Mrs Todd Nora has our breakfast waiting for us But we want some of your delicious milk to last us to the farm Las nights milkins half cream by this time she rejoined as she briskly reentered the house The man at the table held out his empty glass Here fill this up he said to Lucky Todd The somber-faced proprietor turned his gaze from the Merrick group to the stranger eyed him pensively moment and then faced the wagon again The man in gray got up placed the empty glass in Todds hand whirled him around facing the door and said sternly More milk The landlord walked in like an automaton and suppressed giggle came from the girls in the wagon Uncle John was likewise amused and despite the unknowns frazzled apparel the little millionaire addressed him in the same tone he would have used toward an equal Dont blame you sir Nobody ever tasted better milk than they have at the Junction House The man who had resumed his seat stood up took off his hat and bowed But he made no reply Out came Mrs Todd accompanied by another frowsy woman Between them they bore huge jug of milk number of thick glasses and plate of crackers The crackers come extry Mr Merrick said the landlady but seein as milks cheap thought you might like em The landlord now came out and placed the strangers glass about half filled with milk on the table before him The man looked at it frowned and tossed off the milk in one gulp More he said holding out the glass Todd shook his head Aint no more he declared His wife overheard him and pausing in her task of refilling the glasses for the rich mans party she looked over her shoulder and said Give him what he wants Lucky The landlord pondered Not fer ten cents Nancy he protested The feller said he wanted ten cents wuth breakfas an by Joe hes had it Milks cheap remarked Mrs Todd Its crackers as is expensive these days Fill up his glass Lucky Why is your husband called Lucky Mrs Todd inquired Patsy who was enjoying the cool creamy milk Cause he got me to manage him guess was the laughing reply Todd aint much count nless Im on the spot to order him round The landlord came out with the glass of milk but paused before he set it down Lets see your money he said suspiciously It seemed to the girls who were curiously watching the scene that the tramp flushed under his bronzed skin but without reply he searched in pocket and drew out four copper cents which he laid upon the table After further exploration he abstracted nickel from another pocket and pushed the coins toward the landlord Nother cent said Todd Continued search seemed for time hopeless but at last in quite an unexpected way the man produced the final cent and on receiving it Todd set down the milk Anything more yer honor he asked sarcastically Yes you might bring me the morning paper was the reply Everyone except Todd laughed frankly at this retort Uncle John put two silver dollars in Mrs Todds chubby hand and told Thomas to drive on dunno remarked old Hucks when they were out of earshot whether that fellers jest common tramp or workman goin over to the paper mill at Royal Jedgin from the fact as he had money guess hes workman Wrong Thomas quite wrong said Beth seated just behind him Did you notice his hands No Miss Beth They were not rough and the fingers were slender and delicate Thats the mark of cracksman said Arthur Weldon with laugh If there are any safes out here that are worth cracking Id say look out for the gentleman His face isnt bad at all remarked Patsy reflectively Isnt there any grade between workman and thief Of course asserted Mr Merrick in his brisk way This fellow shabby as he looked might be anything from strolling artist to gentleman down on his luck But whats the news Thomas How are Ethel and Joe Mr an Mrs Wegg is quite comftble sir thank you replied old Hucks with show of eagerness Miss Ethels granther ol Will Thompson hes dead you know an the young folks hev fixed up the Thompson house like palace Guess yed better speak to em about spendin so much money Mr Merrick Im fraid they may need it some day Dont worry Theyve fine income for life Thomas and there will be plenty to leave to their children if they have any But tell me about the mill at Royal Where _is_ Royal anyhow Four mile up the Little Bill Creek sir where the Royal Waterfall is feller come an looked the place over las year an said the pine forest would grind up inter paper an the waterfall would do the grindin So he bought mile forest an built mill an they do say things is hummin up to the new settlement Theres moren two hundred hands a-workin there aready Goodness me cried Patsy this thing must have livened up sleepy old Millville considerably Not yet said Hucks shaking his head The compny what owns the mill keeps store there for the workmen an none of em come much to Millville Our storekeepers is maddern blazes about it but fer my part Im glad the two places is separated Why asked Louise Theyre kinder tough lot guess Turnin pine trees inter paper mus be job thet takes more muscle than brains dont see how its done at all Its simple enough said Mr Merrick First the wood is ground into pulp and then the pulp is run through hot rollers coming out paper Its mighty interesting process so some day we will all go to Royal and see the paper made But not just yet Uncle remarked Patsy Lets have time to settle down on the farm and enjoy it Oh how glad am to be back in this restful sleepy jumping-off-place of the world again Isnt it delightful Arthur Weldon Did you ever breathe such ozony delicious mountain air And do you get the fragrance of the pine forests and the the The bumps asked Arthur as the wagon gave jolt bit more emphatic than usual yes Patsy dear get them all but wont pass judgment on Millville and Uncle Johns farm just yet Are we most there Were to have four whole months of it sighed Beth That ought to enable us to renew our youth after the strenuous winter Rubbish said Uncle John You havent known strenuous moment my dears and youre all too young to need renewals anyhow But if you can find happiness here my girls our old farm will become paradise These three nieces of Mr Merrick were well worth looking at Louise the eldest was now twenty entirely too young to be bride but having decided to marry Arthur Weldon the girl would brook no interference and having will of her own overcame all opposition Her tall slender form was exceedingly graceful and willowy her personality dainty and refined her temperament under ordinary conditions essentially sweet and agreeable In crises Louise developed considerable character in strong contrast with her usual assumption of well-bred composure That the girl was insincere in little things and cultivated polished manner to conceal her real feelings is undeniable but in spite of this she might be relied upon to prove loyal and true in emergencies Patricia Doyle was more than two years the junior of her cousin Louise and very unlike her Patsys old father Major Gregory Doyle said she wore her heart on her sleeve and the girl was frank and outspoken to fault Patsy had no figure to speak of being somewhat dumpy in build nor were her piquant features at all beautiful Her nose tipped at the end her mouth was broad and full-lipped and her complexion badly freckled But Patsys hair was of that indescribable shade that hovers between burnished gold and sunset carmine Fiery red she was wont to describe it and most people considered it very justly one of her two claims to distinction Her other admirable feature was pair of magnificent deep blue eyes merry mischievous and scintillating as diamonds Few could resist those eyes and certain it is that Patsy Doyle was universal favorite and won friends without particle of effort The younger of the three nieces Elizabeth De Graf was as beautiful girl as you will often discover one of those rarely perfect creations that excite our wonder and compel admiration as beautiful picture or bit of statuary will Dreamy and reserved in disposition she lacked the graciousness of Louise and Patsys compelling good humor yet you must not think her stupid or disagreeable Her reserve was really diffidence her dreamy expressionless gaze the result of serious nature and thoughtful temperament Beth was quite practical and matter-of-fact the reverse of Patsys imaginative instincts or Louises affected indifference Those who knew Beth De Graf best loved her dearly but strangers found her hard to approach and were often repulsed by her unresponsive manner Underneath all the girl was real girl with many splendid qualities and Uncle John relied upon Beths stability more than on that of his other two nieces Her early life had been stormy and unhappy one so she was but now developing her real nature beneath the warmth of her uncles protecting love Topping the brow of little hill the wagon came to smooth downward grade where the road met the quaint old bridge that spanned Little Bill Creek beside which stood the antiquated flour and feed mill that had given Millville its name The horses were able to maintain their brisk trot across the bridge and through the main street of the town which was merely cluster of unimposing frame buildings that lined either side of the highway for the space of an ordinary city block Then they were in the wilds again and rattling over another cobblestone trail This ere countrys nuthn but pine woods cobblestones sighed old Hucks as the horses subsided to walk Lor knows what would happened to us without the trees They saves our grace sos to speak think the scenery is beautiful observed Patsy Its so different from other country places Not much farming around here imagine said Arthur Weldon More than youd think sir replied Thomas Theres certain crops as thrives in stony land an few miles north here towards Huntingdon the soils mighty rich productive Things aint never as bad as they seem in this world sir he added turning his persistently smiling face toward the young man Mr Merrick sat beside the driver on the front seat The middle seat was occupied by Patsy ']"
